# LLM-payground
I see a lot of interesting and cool stuff built around LLM these days. In this repo, I will include some of them that I had a chance to create myself.

1. Chat with github repo : As part of Activeloop's course on Langchain and vectorDB, there is a lesson on creating a LLM based chatbot for interacting with any github profile.
   This repo https://github.com/peterw/Chat-with-Github-Repo/tree/main contains an implementation for that lesson. I will be using a Jupyter notebook to reconstruct it from scratch while also sharing my thought process behind every step in the process.
