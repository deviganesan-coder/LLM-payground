# LLM-payground
I see a lot of interesting and cool stuff built around LLM these days. In this repo, I will include some of them that I had a chance to create myself.

1. Chat_with_github_repo.ipynb : In this Jupyter notebook, I have construct a LLM powered custom chatbot from scratch while also sharing my thought process behind every step in the process. This is inspired from Activeloop's course on Langchain and vectorDB which includes a lesson on creating a LLM based chatbot for interacting with any github profile.
Link to the original repo containing code for that lesson: https://github.com/peterw/Chat-with-Github-Repo/tree/main. Another useful resource to refer to is https://www.activeloop.ai/resources/lang-chain-gpt-4-for-code-understanding-twitter-algorithm/ .

2. Chat_streamlit.ipynb: In this notebook, I will explore the use of streamlit app to create the frontend for our chat application.
